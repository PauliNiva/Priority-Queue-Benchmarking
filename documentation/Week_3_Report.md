This week I have made custom hash map, treap and pairing heap. I also started to plan out the specifics of the benchmarking.

Project has gone forward according to the plans and no special difficulties were encountered during the week.

Work to be done next week: refactor the already made classes as need arises, make a class for graphs and finish the planning on benchmarks and start to implement them.
