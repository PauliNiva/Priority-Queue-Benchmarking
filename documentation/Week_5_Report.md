This week I made Dijkstra for the the project and a benchmark and tests for it. I also made decrease key method for the appropriate classes. Also some refactoring was done.
 
I spent better part of this week trying to get the binomial heap class to work as expected. As of yet success has eluded me in this endeavor. Because there is bound to be some major restructuring in the program I have decided not to make implementation document and testing document yet.

Next week I am trying to fix the binomial and fibonacci heaps. Polish the program and lastly write the documents.
