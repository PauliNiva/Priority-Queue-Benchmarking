I have used this week setting up git repo and planning for the project. Also I made the specification document and started working on a couple of data structures, namely binary and d-heap.

Project has started nicely in my opinion. Biggest problem that I had this week was writing the specification document for the project.

Work to be done next week: finish already started heaps and make at least leftist heap, skew heap, binomial heap complete and fibonacci heap complete. I'm spending next week in logic colloquium, so that is going to limit the amount of work that I am going to be able to do.
