JUnit testing of the project:

Project is tested using JUnit testing.
99 JUnit test where written and some tests test more than one thing at a time.
Testing method used was white-box testing.
Jacoco reports the line coverage as 96% covered. Main method is not tested and also some getters and setters are not tested.
These are not tested because of the simplicity of these methods, and main is user tested every time the program is run.
Branch coverage is reported at 92% due to code having branches that are impossible to get into and also, there are branches that one can get to, but these branches do not do anything or are sufficiently simple, so the tests are omitted.
Dijkstra is tested with a two small graphs and the resulting array is checked against the values that they should be.

Functional testing.
Program was tested to function on Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems. In these tests, the tests where run several times and also the main program was ran several times, and the program was confirmed to work correctly.
