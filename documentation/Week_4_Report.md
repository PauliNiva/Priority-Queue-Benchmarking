This week I have made interface and decrease key method for heaps. I also made three benchmarks: Inserting to the heap, deleting from the heap and sorting of a random array with help of heaps. Also did some major refactoring when moving all the node subclasses to one node class (which is ugly as hell at the moment).

Project has gone forward according to the plans and no special difficulties were encountered during the week, except skew heap was flawed so I spent better part of a day scratching my head. Got it fixed though.

Work to be done next week: refactor the already made classes as need arises, Tidy up the code and make some more benchmarks.
