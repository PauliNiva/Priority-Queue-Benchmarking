In this week I have made Fibonacci, Leftist, Skew, and binomial heaps. I also made some minor refactoring to the binary and d-heaps.

Project has gone forward according to the plans and no special difficulties were encountered during the week.

Work to be done next week: polish the already made heaps and also add decrease key -method to them. I am also considering the possibility to switch the treap to an 'if time permits' status and make pairing heap instead, as it functions better with other heaps. Any how, I am planning to make at least one of them (both if time permits). On top of these, I will start planning the benchmarking tests that will be implemented.
